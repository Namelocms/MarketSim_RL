# MarketSim_RL
Work in progress

An agent based market simulation framework written in Python for reinforcement learning.

This repo implements a simulated market environment with order books and RL agents that can learn strategies for interacting with the market (e.g., trading, order placement) using machine learning techniques.

## Features
- Market simulation with order book dynamics
- Reinforcement learning agent training and evaluation (WIP)
- Modular architecture for Agents, Orders, OrderBook, and Utilities
- Test suite under `tests/`
- GUI components for visualization (WIP)
